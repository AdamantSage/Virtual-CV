##What i learned
CSS can take plain boring hmtl and transform it into this visually appealing masterpiece. brushed up on my html fundamentals and learnt new ones. this process not only opened up new possibilities for design and layout but this process refurbushed and expanded my skillset boosting my confidence to continue practicing making more projects using html,css and javascript.

I used Netlify to deploy my website. (https://www.netlify.com/)

Continued Development
I aim to sharpen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills so that I may create better functional and useful projects for myself and people of interest.

Navigation
There is a navbar that has Home, About, Projects, Skills, contact me which will take you to the appropriate section on the webpage.
Download CV button will allow you to download my latest CV that explains my other set of skills.

Button that will enable you to view my github page with all my repositories

in the webapge there are 3 prjoects currently being shown, 1 is an Encryption app which you can view the source coude by clicking on the button and it will take you to my github page which has its code.

There is also a website card that will show you how ive created this wepsite by leading you to its source code in my github.

the third is the web application that is still under development(will be done throughout the semester), the website cautions you that it is still not complete so try again later and this was done using javascript, maybe it would be uploaded hten(this has been purposely left this way, its not a mistake)

Contact section: here you can put your information if you would like me to contact you regarding a particular problem, maybe you would like me to develop a website for you as well?! It uses Formsubmit which is a platform that helps send emails to me without having to do any nitty gritty long codes.

There is also my linkedin and twitter account found at the center of the bottom of the footer, then finally there is a blue button that will take you all the way back to the top without you having to scroll up.
